# SoNAR
The project "Social Network Analysis and realted Research. SoNAR" (2025-2027) implements a research data market. As a data market, SoNAR facilitates sharing statements about agents and agent relations documented by the cultural heritage maintained and described by libraries, archives, and museums as well as related research initiatives. To this end, the project establishes an infrastructure that continuously aggregates and integrates various types of data from data repositories to infer explicit and implicit statements about agents and agent relations. Scholars and researchers who look for data for Historical Network Research will be able to curate data sets for respective research questions and to trace back each statement to the original resource. The project is supported by an international advisory board and works in close collaboration with data service provider, in particular the Integrated Authority File of the German National Library, the Social Networks and Archival Context cooperative, Museum Digital as well as union cataloging services, namely the Union Catalog of Serials and the KALLIOPE Union Catalog.

The project is publicly funded by the [German Research Foundation](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/558129968).
