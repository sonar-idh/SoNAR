# SoNAR
Project (2025-2027) to implement a research data market for sharing data about agents and agent relations encoded with the cultural heritage maintained by libraries, archives, and museums.

The project establishes an infrastructure that continiously aggregates and integrates various types of data from data repositories to infer explicit and implicit statements about agents and agent relations. Scolars and researchers looking for data for Historical Network Research will be able to curate data sets for respective research questions and to trace back each statement to the original resource. The project works in close collaboration with representatives of various research communities and data service provider, during this initial phase with the Integrated Authority File of the German National Library, the Social Network and Archival Contexts cooperative, Museum Digital as well as union cataloging services, namely the Union Catalog of Serials and the KALLIOPE Union Catalog.
